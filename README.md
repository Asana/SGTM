# SGTM
This is an application that syncs your GitHub pull requests with Asana tasks so engineers can manage all of their work within Asana and have tasks assigned to them when their review is needed.

This is an adapted version of a Clojure app that was originally written for internal use by Asana engineers and is still under active development.

## Installation
We recommend setting up a virtualenvironment to install and run your python environment.

When first setting up your repository, you should install all required python dependencies using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt`.

## Running Tests
`python3 -m unittest discover`
